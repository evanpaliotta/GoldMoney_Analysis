Goldmoney-- The Marriage of Investing, Banking and Payments
Overview and Origin
Name of Company: Goldmoney Inc.-- previously BitGold Inc. (name was changed July 2015) [*1] Incorporation: 2001 [*1]
Ticker: XAUMF on the American OTC market [*2] and XAU.TO (also TSX:XAU) on the Toronto Stock Exchange [*3]
Founders: Roy Sebag (CEO), Josh Crumb (CFO), James Turk (Lead Director) [*4]
Origin Story: Roy's mission upon founding BitGold was to broaden access to precious metals ownership through innovative technology. In order to accomplish this task, he realized he needed to disrupt the banking industry as well as the jewelry industry [*5--minute 4:16].
Funding: From January 2015-March 2016 BitGold Inc. had six Reg D offerings of undisclosed amounts [*6]. The Canadian equivalent of EDGAR is called SEDAR and their records only go back to May 2015 and do not include offering documents [*7]. Crunchbase, the hub of funding information, states that Goldmoney had one round of Post-IPO funding on October 3, 2017 for $30M CAD [*8]. There were two primary Canadian institutional backers: GMP Securities and Mackie Research Capital Corporation. They went public on May 13, 2015.
Business Activities
Problems the company solves: In theory, precious metals ownership is simple. There are two main ways to invest in the market; You can either go to a bullion dealer with cash and walk out with the metal of your choice or you can purchase paper contracts on an exchange like GLD. Both options have significant financial and security risks. If you get physical metal you have to store it in a safe space to which you can either hide it in your house or get a safety deposit box with a monthly fee attached. With paper contracts, and any financial security in general, you have counterparty risk; one person's asset is another's liability. In the case of GLD, the custodian is HSBC [*9] and they are responsible for securing the underlying asset. Although they are regulated by the SEC, their enforcement is not 100% guaranteed (ex. HSBC's money laundering incident with the Sinaloa Cartel). In addition, the GLD prospectus states "GLD represents fractional, undivided interest in the trust"[*9]. This means that in the case of default or other issues, the owner of GLD does not have direct ownership of the underlying security, rather in the trust itself. In either case there are liquidity issues because you cannot spend your asset on household items, rather you'd need to sell in order to purchase these essential goods. Goldmoney solves all the aforementioned issues. When you sign up for an account your money is 100% backed by physical metal and stored in a Brinks vault in one of 5 locations worldwide. If you'd like to liquidate your position you have the option of getting physical metal by delivery. In regards to liquidity, you get a debit card that allows you to purchase goods and services. Goldmoney will take out a fractional percentage of your holdings based on current spot prices. If your metal appreciated, you have more purchasing power however the converse is true as well. In addition to the storage, payments, and liquidity concerns addressed, Goldmoney also has a mobile platform for tracking holdings.
Intended customer: Goldmoney's mission is to democratize ownership of precious metals including gold, silver, platinum and palladium. Their mission indicates that their intended customer is every global citizen. They have ~$2B AUM with customers in over 150 countries. [*8]
Market size of customer: It's difficult to determine the market size of the average customer because, in theory, Goldmoney can replace traditional commercial banks. That being said, the gold market alone is ~$8T market (5.7B ounces x current price of gold) [*10] although most of the holdings are held by central banks.
Competitive advantage: The traditional models of precious metal companies include bullion sales directly to the consumer and also storage. Goldmoney has these features although it is the only company in the world that incorporates payments. Most traditional precious metals companies allow holdings of one or a few currencies but Goldmoney allows redemptions in 9 currencies including USD, GBP, EUR, CAD, CHF, JPY, NZD, HKD, and AUD. You may also redeem BTC for precious metals if you wish to do so. [*11] The mobile app is another competitive advantage.
Technologies utilized: Goldmoney is plugged into the Mastercard ecosystem so they utilize their technologies and network to process and send payments. They have a downloadable widget with live price tracking of the four precious metals along with the nine offered currencies.
Landscape
Domain: Goldmoney operates in a few domains including payments, commercial banking, commodities, and investing.
Major trends and innovation: Over the last decade, there has not been much innovation among precious metal dealers. The only major innovations are home delivery and asset tracking. Goldmoney innovates above and beyond that of traditional bullion dealers. In regards to payments, there has been much more innovation over the past decade. With widespread access to smartphones and bank accounts, the average person can purchase goods with a card or their phone. Companies trailblazing this payments revolution include, Stripe, Paypal, Venmo, Apple Pay etc... Blockchain technology is another trend that will shape this industry in the years to come.
Competitors: The competitors include bullion dealers, commercial banks, and asset managers. Since Goldmoney performs such a unique service that disrupts multiple industries, it is difficult to deduce direct, natural competitors.
Results
Business impact: Goldmoney is a revolutionary company without the revolutionary presence. I believe this is due to the fact that people are still comfortable with our current banking system. Two billion assets under management is nothing to shake a stick at however in the financial services space, a $1.5T industry, it's not that much. [*13]
Core metrics and performance: The financial services industry is predominantly gauged on asset gathering. Due to this fact, the core metric for many of these firms is AUM. Goldmoney currently has ~$2B AUM [*8]. In addition to AUM, other important metrics include revenue, gross margin, gross margin percentage, and gross profit. Goldmoney has a revenue of $108.1M, gross margin of $2.5M, gross margin percentage of 2.28% and a gross profit of $4.4M [*12].
Relative performance: As previously mentioned, it's very difficult to determine this company's natural competitors because it taps into so many industries including asset management, payments, storage, commercial banking etc... Given the name of the company and market capitalization comparisons, I believe the industry this company will disrupt most is bullion dealers. The top competitors in the United States include JM Bullion ($661.3M in revenue), Apmex ($300M in revenue), and SD Bullion ($129.6M in 2016 which was the most recent data) [*13,*14, *15]. Given the revenue of Goldmoney at $108.1M, it is a true competitor of the bullion ownership space.
Recommendations
Suggested products/services: If I were to advise the company, I'd suggest they shift their marketing to focus on the commercial banking sector. It's a far larger arena to tap into then the bullion industry because they would be able to make loans and charge interest. If they want to compete with commercial banks, they need to venture into the lending business. A technological solution I'd suggest is automatic asset re-balancing based on mining discoveries, FX and derivative markets. Even though Goldmoney's model is to have 100% backing, they can expand their business by creating derivative contracts backed by their holdings. Many asset managers have accompanying media companies to prove their competencies and entail, generate business.
Benefits of suggested products/services:If our current financial system was not based on growth, I would be hard pressed to come up with any insightful suggestions. To elaborate, we collectively value companies based on current value and prospective ability to grow rather than the sustainability of the business or other qualitative factors. Due to our current paradigm, I made suggestions on how they could grow as quickly as possible. Commercial banks expand when their reserve requirement shrinks, hence why the Fed is currently lowering the reserve requirement to zero for the first time in history [*16]. Lowering the reserve ratio expands the lending capacity of the institution and thus grows their profits via interest payments. Currently Goldmoney does not lend but if they want to grow their business they need to entertain the idea. An asset re-balancing platform will help their clients reduce risk by limiting their exposure to riskier, overvalued metals while increasing that of undervalued ones.
Additional technologies: An automatic re-balancing platform and derivative offerings would utilize algorithmic trading with specific execution protocols. In addition, they can implement machine learning algorithms to monetize their data. Barclays has implemented smart-contracts and blockchain to trade derivatives and Goldmoney can follow suit if they expand into that market. [*17]
Why these: Algorithmic trading is appropriate because it will permit Goldmoney to execute trades at the best possible prices, reduce transaction costs, reduce risk of manual errors, increase speed of execution etc...
